/**
 * The interface used to define conditional expressions.
 *
 * In order to be compatible with most of the languages, the 'IfTree' is not defined 
 * as a statement and should be considered as an expression.
 *
 * A 'IfTree' always has:
 * - a keyword ('if', '?', 'unless', ...)
 * - a condition
 * - a 'then' branch 
 * 
 * Additionally, it's possible to also have:
 * - an 'else' keyword
 * - an 'else' branch (which does not necessarily requires a 'else' keyword)
 * 
 * Known mapping from languages conditional expressions to IfTree:
 * - Apex:   if, ternary (a?b:c)
 * - Kotlin: if
 * - Ruby:   if, ternary (a?b:c), unless (equivalent to 'if not')
 * - Scala:  if
